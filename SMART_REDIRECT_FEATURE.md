---

## 📝 What Changed

### Before (Old Behavior):
```
Edit Email/WhatsApp/Patrol/Surveillance
   ↓
Click "Save Assessment"
   ↓
Redirects to: Same intelligence detail page
   ↓
You have to manually:
   1. Go back to Alleged Subject List
   2. Find the POI profile
   3. Click to see updated data
```

### After (New Smart Redirect):
```
Edit Email/WhatsApp/Patrol/Surveillance
   ↓
Click "Save Assessment"
   ↓
System checks: Is there a linked POI?
   ↓
   YES → POI-069 linked
   ↓
Automatic redirect to: /alleged_subject_profile/POI-069
   ↓
You immediately see:
   ✅ Updated POI profile
   ✅ New intelligence in timeline
   ✅ Updated statistics
   ✅ All cross-source data
   
   NO → No POI linked yet
   ↓
Automatic redirect to: /alleged_subject_list
   ↓
You see all POI profiles to verify
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### New Helper Function:
```python
def get_linked_poi_for_intelligence(source_type, source_id):
    """
    Find POI profile linked to an intelligence entry
    
    Args:
        source_type: "EMAIL", "WHATSAPP", "PATROL", "SURVEILLANCE"
        source_id: Database ID of the intelligence entry
        
    Returns:
        POI ID string (e.g., "POI-069") or None if not found
    """
```

### Updated Routes:

**1. Email Intelligence (`int_source_email_detail`):**
```python
# After saving assessment
linked_poi = get_linked_poi_for_intelligence('EMAIL', email_id)
if linked_poi:
    flash(f'Assessment saved. Viewing POI profile: {linked_poi}', 'success')
    return redirect(url_for('alleged_subject_profile_detail', poi_id=linked_poi))
else:
    return redirect(url_for('alleged_subject_list'))
```

**2. WhatsApp Intelligence (`whatsapp_detail`):**
- Redirects after saving **complaint details** (edit mode)
- Redirects after saving **assessment** (view mode)

**3. Online Patrol (`online_patrol_detail`):**
- Redirects after saving **patrol details** (edit mode)
- Redirects after saving **assessment** (view mode)

**4. Surveillance (`surveillance_detail`):**
- Redirects after saving **surveillance entry updates**

Step 1: Go to WhatsApp entry detail page
Step 2: Click "Edit" and change alleged person to "陳大文"

Step 2: Update location and findings
Step 3: Click "Save"

Result:
   ✅ System finds first linked POI (POI-045)
   ✅ Redirects to POI-045 profile page
