- Regular backup of encrypted data and keys

### Access Control
- Change all default passwords immediately
- Implement strong password policies
- Use multi-factor authentication where possible
- Regular access reviews and user audits
- Principle of least privilege

### Monitoring and Logging
- Enable comprehensive audit logging
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up security alerts and notifications
- Regular log analysis and review
- Integration with SIEM systems

### Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Secure key management practices
- Regular security assessments
- Data loss prevention measures
- Compliance with data protection regulations
