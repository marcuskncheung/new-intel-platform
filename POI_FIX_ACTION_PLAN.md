# POI System - Immediate Action Plan

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE

**Problem:** POI profiles exist but show NO sources (no emails, no WhatsApp, nothing)

**Example:** POI-082 shows "Found 0 intelligence links" when you click on it

---

## ✅ SOLUTION DEPLOYED

**Commit fb8010f** adds error handling to catch why source links aren't being created.

---

## 📋 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Deploy Latest Code
```bash
ssh saiuapp11
cd /path/to/new-intel-platform
git pull origin main
docker-compose restart
```

### Step 2: Click "Refresh POI" Button
1. Go to POI list page
2. Click "Refresh All Sources" button
3. Wait for completion

### Step 3: Watch Docker Logs
```bash
docker logs -f intelligence-app | grep "POI REFRESH"
```

---

## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### ✅ GOOD - Links Created Successfully
```
[POI REFRESH] 🔍 Checking if link exists for POI POI-082 → EMAIL-123
[POI REFRESH] ➕ Creating new link: POI-082 ← EMAIL-123 (case_id=456)
[POI REFRESH] ✅ Source link created: POI-082 ← EMAIL-123
```

**If you see this:** Source links are working! POI-082 will now show EMAIL-123.

---

### ❌ BAD - Link Creation Failed
```
[POI REFRESH] 🔍 Checking if link exists for POI POI-082 → EMAIL-123
[POI REFRESH] ➕ Creating new link: POI-082 ← EMAIL-123 (case_id=None)
[POI REFRESH] ❌ ERROR creating link for POI-082 ← EMAIL-123: IntegrityError
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/app/poi_refresh_system.py", line 120, in refresh_poi_from_all_sources
    db.session.add(new_link)
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (psycopg2.errors.ForeignKeyViolation) insert or update on table "poi_intelligence_link" violates foreign key constraint
```

**If you see this:** There's a database schema issue! Report the exact error message.

---

### ⚠️ WARNING - No POI ID Returned
```
[POI REFRESH] ⚠️ WARNING: No POI ID returned from create_or_update! Result: {'success': False, 'error': '...'}
```

**If you see this:** The POI creation is failing. Check the error details.

---

### ⚠️ WARNING - Name Count Mismatch
```
[POI REFRESH] ⚠️ WARNING: Email 123 has 2 English names but 3 Chinese names!
[POI REFRESH] ⚠️ English: ['Bay Insurance Brokers Limited', 'John Chan']
[POI REFRESH] ⚠️ Chinese: ['灣區保險經紀有限公司', '湾区保险经纪有限公司', '陈伟']
[POI REFRESH] ⚠️ Names will be paired by position - THIS MAY CREATE INCORRECT POI PROFILES!
```

**If you see this:** The assessment data has mismatched names. You need to fix the assessment manually.

## 🐛 DEBUGGING - If POI Still Shows 0 Links

### Check 1: Verify Link Exists in Database
```sql
SELECT * FROM poi_intelligence_link 
WHERE poi_id = 'POI-082';
```

**Expected:** Should return at least 1 row showing the email/WhatsApp source

**If empty:** Links are NOT being created - check error logs above

**If has rows:** Links exist but UI is not showing them - this is a display bug

---

### Check 2: Verify POI Profile Exists
```sql
SELECT poi_id, name_english, name_chinese, status 
FROM alleged_person_profile 
WHERE poi_id = 'POI-082';
```

**Expected:** Should return 1 row with status='ACTIVE'

**If empty:** POI doesn't exist - something deleted it

**If status='MERGED':** POI was merged - this is correct behavior

---

### Check 3: Check Assessment Data
```sql
SELECT id, alleged_subject_english, alleged_subject_chinese, caseprofile_id
FROM email 
WHERE alleged_subject_english LIKE '%<name from POI-082>%';
```

**This shows:** Which emails mention this person and whether they have a case assigned

---

## 📊 COMMON ERROR PATTERNS

### Error 1: Foreign Key Violation
```
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: insert or update on table "poi_intelligence_link" 
violates foreign key constraint "poi_intelligence_link_poi_id_fkey"
```

**Cause:** Trying to link to a POI that doesn't exist yet

**Fix:** Ensure `create_or_update_alleged_person_profile()` commits before creating links

---

### Error 2: Duplicate Key
```
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "poi_intelligence_link_pkey"
```

**Cause:** Trying to create a link that already exists

**Fix:** Check `existing_link` query is working correctly

---

### Error 3: NULL Constraint
```
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: null value in column "poi_id" violates not-null constraint
```

**Cause:** `result.get('poi_id')` returned None

**Fix:** Check why `create_or_update_alleged_person_profile()` didn't return a POI ID

## 📞 REPORT BACK

After deploying and clicking "Refresh POI", please send me:

1. **Any ERROR logs** you see (copy the full traceback)
2. **The warning logs** about name mismatches
3. **Example POI ID** that shows 0 links (e.g., POI-082)
4. **SQL query results** from Debug Check 1 above

This will help me identify the exact problem!

**Priority:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**  
**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes to deploy and test  
**Next Update:** After you deploy and check the logs
