## 📊 How Your System Works Right Now

### 1️⃣ **WhatsApp Intelligence Entry** 🟢 WORKING

#### When You Submit WhatsApp Entry:

**Step 1: Auto-Generate INT Reference Number**
```
Receipt Time: 2025-10-17 14:30:00 HKT
↓
System finds chronological position based on date
↓
Earlier entries: 45 → New entry gets INT-046
↓
All later entries automatically renumbered (INT-047, INT-048...)
```

**Step 2: Extract Alleged Person Names**
```
You enter in "Alleged Person" field: "陳大文, John Smith"
↓
System splits by comma: ["陳大文", "John Smith"]
↓
Processes each name separately
```

**Step 3: Auto-Create or Update POI Profiles**
```
For "陳大文" (Chinese name):
   ↓
   Check if profile exists → Uses smart matching:
      - Normalized name comparison
      - Chinese character exact match
      - Agent number match
      - Company match
   ↓
   IF EXISTS:
      ✅ Merge into existing POI (e.g., POI-069)
      - Update last_mentioned_date
      - Increment intelligence count
      - Add new WhatsApp link
   ↓
   IF NEW:
      🆕 Create new profile POI-070
      - Generate next POI ID
      - Set name_chinese = "陳大文"
      - Set created_by = "WHATSAPP"
      - Status = "ACTIVE"
```

**Step 4: Create Universal Intelligence Link**
```
Creates entry in poi_intelligence_link table:
   - poi_id: "POI-069"
   - source_type: "WHATSAPP"
   - source_id: 123 (WhatsApp entry ID)
   - case_id: (if linked to case)
   - confidence_score: 0.90 (automation)
   - extraction_method: "AUTOMATION"
   - created_by: "USER-kinnam"
```

**Step 5: Success Message**
```
✅ "WhatsApp entry created and 2 POI profile(s) processed."
```

### 2️⃣ **Editing WhatsApp Entry** 🟢 WORKING

#### What You Can Edit:

✅ **INT Reference Number** - You can manually change it
- System will NOT auto-renumber after creation
- You have full control to override

✅ **Alleged Person Names** - Add/remove/change names
- System will NOT auto-update POI links
- Existing POI profiles remain unchanged
- You need to manually update POI profiles separately

✅ **Assessment Details** - Free text editing
- allegation_details
- alleged_nature
- classification
- etc.

⚠️ **Important Note:** 
- POI automation ONLY runs on **NEW entries**
- Editing existing entries does NOT trigger re-automation
- This prevents accidental profile duplication

---

### 3️⃣ **POI Profile Auto-Creation Logic** 🧠

#### Matching Algorithm (Prevents Duplicates):

```python
Priority 1: Exact Name Match
   - Chinese: "陳大文" == "陳大文" → 100% match
   - English: "john smith" == "john smith" → 100% match

Priority 2: Agent/License Number Match
   - Agent: "E-123456" → Finds any profile with same number
   - High confidence merge

Priority 3: Fuzzy Name Matching (English only)
   - "JOHN SMITH" vs "John Smith" → 95% similarity
   - "Jon Smyth" vs "John Smith" → 85% similarity
   - Threshold: 90% → Merge
   - Below 90% → Create new profile

Priority 4: Company + Partial Name Match
   - Company: "ABC Realty" + Name contains "SMITH"
   - Medium confidence → Manual review suggested
```

#### What Happens When Profile Exists:

**MERGE MODE (default):**
```
Existing POI-069:
   - name_chinese: "陳大文"
   - email_count: 3
   - last_mentioned_date: 2025-10-10
   
New WhatsApp mention:
   ↓
   System updates POI-069:
   - email_count: 3 (unchanged)
   - whatsapp_count: +1
   - last_mentioned_date: 2025-10-17 (updated)
   - Adds new intelligence link
   
Result: POI-069 now shows 1 WhatsApp entry in timeline
```
