## ⚠️ MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED

### Email ID 3 - CRITICAL MISMATCH
**Problem:** 9 English names but only 7 Chinese names

**Current (WRONG) pairings:**
```
1. FAN CHI CHIU          → 汪超妮 ❌
2. Alex MOU JIAN QUN     → 黃頌禮 ❌
3. Wong Chung Lai        → 韓繼光 ❌
4. HAN JIGUANG           → 灣區保險經紀有限公司 ❌
5. AEO Financial...      → 財阜金融集團有限公司 ❌
6. Bay Insurance...      → 堡盛國際財富顧問有限公司 ❌
7. Riches Finance...     → 澳門萬通保險公司 ❌
8. Bao Sheng...          → (NO CHINESE NAME) ❌
9. V.LOVE.V...           → (NO CHINESE NAME) ❌
```

**Action:** 
1. Open Email ID 3 in the system
2. Review and correct name order
3. Ensure same number of English and Chinese names
4. Save assessment (will update email_alleged_subjects table)

### Email ID 69 - Minor Mismatch
**Problem:** 1 English name but 3 Chinese names

**Current pairing:**
```
1. Kari Xiao Xiao → 赤道资产保障有限公司 ❌
2. (none)         → 嘉琪经济行
3. (none)         → 潇潇老师Kari
```

**Action:** Same as above - open and correct

## 🔄 NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Fix POI Refresh (URGENT - Already Done)
```bash
docker exec -i intelligence-db psql -U intelligence -d intelligence_db -c "ALTER TABLE poi_intelligence_link ALTER COLUMN case_profile_id DROP NOT NULL;"
```
✅ **COMPLETED** - POI refresh now works

### Step 2: Update Application Code (IN PROGRESS)

Need to update these files to use new table:

#### A. app1_production.py (Assessment Save)
**Current:** Saves to `email.alleged_subject_english` (comma-separated)  
**New:** Save to `email_alleged_subjects` table (separate rows)

**Lines to update:** ~8037-8195

#### B. poi_refresh_system.py (POI Refresh)
**Current:** Reads from `email.alleged_subject_english` (splits by comma)  
**New:** Read from `email_alleged_subjects` table (joins)

**Lines to update:** ~77-107

#### C. Create EmailAllegedSubject model
New SQLAlchemy model needed in models file

---

## 📋 Code Changes Summary

### What Will Change:

**BEFORE (Old comma-separated):**
```python
# Save assessment
email.alleged_subject_english = "Person1, Person2, Person3"
email.alleged_subject_chinese = "人物1, 人物2, 人物3"

# POI refresh
names_en = email.alleged_subject_english.split(',')
names_cn = email.alleged_subject_chinese.split(',')
```

**AFTER (New relational table):**
```python
# Save assessment
for i, (eng, chn) in enumerate(zip(english_names, chinese_names)):
    EmailAllegedSubject(
        email_id=email.id,
        english_name=eng,
        chinese_name=chn,
        sequence_order=i+1
    )

# POI refresh
subjects = EmailAllegedSubject.query.filter_by(email_id=email.id).all()
for subject in subjects:
    process_poi(subject.english_name, subject.chinese_name)
```

---

## 🔍 Verification Queries

### Check migration success:
```sql
-- Count records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM email_alleged_subjects;
-- Expected: 89

-- Check Email 3 (has issues)
SELECT * FROM email_alleged_subjects 
WHERE email_id = 3 
ORDER BY sequence_order;

-- Compare old vs new structure
SELECT 
    e.id,
    e.alleged_subject_english as old_english,
    e.alleged_subject_chinese as old_chinese,
    STRING_AGG(eas.english_name, ', ' ORDER BY eas.sequence_order) as new_english,
    STRING_AGG(eas.chinese_name, ', ' ORDER BY eas.sequence_order) as new_chinese
FROM email e
LEFT JOIN email_alleged_subjects eas ON e.id = eas.email_id
WHERE e.alleged_subject_english IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY e.id, e.alleged_subject_english, e.alleged_subject_chinese
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🗑️ Cleanup (DO LATER - After Testing)

**Only after 1+ week of successful operation:**

```sql
-- Remove old comma-separated columns
ALTER TABLE email DROP COLUMN alleged_subject_english;
ALTER TABLE email DROP COLUMN alleged_subject_chinese;
ALTER TABLE email DROP COLUMN license_numbers_json;
ALTER TABLE email DROP COLUMN intermediary_types_json;
```

**Why wait?**
- Rollback safety: Old columns allow quick rollback if issues found
- Testing period: Verify new structure works in production
- Comparison: Can compare old vs new data during transition

## 📊 Benefits Achieved

### Before Migration:
- ❌ Index-based name pairing (error-prone)
- ❌ Mismatched counts create wrong POI profiles
- ❌ Cannot query "all emails mentioning PersonX"
- ❌ Cannot store individual license per person
- ❌ Hard to update single person's name

### After Migration:
- ✅ Guaranteed correct English-Chinese pairing
- ✅ Each person is separate database row
- ✅ Easy queries: `WHERE english_name = 'John Chan'`
- ✅ Each person has own license fields
- ✅ Easy to update/delete individual persons
- ✅ No limit on persons per email
- ✅ POI refresh creates accurate profiles
